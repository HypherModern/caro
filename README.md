# Tic Tac Toe

**A basic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.**

## How to Get Started
1. To make a move, the player will use a single mouse click to mark a space. Once a move is made, the game proceeds to the next player's turn. If two players make the 6th move but no one win, then the game will start delete the first move and continue interleave with two players.
2. At each move, the game will indicate whose turn (Player A or Player B) it is. The game will have no draw and endless unless a player makes a mistake and the other take it. There will be only two results:
   * Winner: Player A
   * Winner: Player B
